### Steganography Algorithms

1. **LSB (Least Significant Bit)**
   - Higher capacity
   - Faster processing
   - Good for text and small files
   - Minimal quality loss

2. **DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform)**
   - Better security
   - More robust against compression
   - Lower capacity
   - Slower processing

## Usage Instructions

### Hiding Data in Video

1. **Select Cover Video**: Click "Browse" in the Cover Video section
   - Choose a video file (max 50 MB)
   - View video information and maximum payload capacity

2. **Select Secret File**: Click "Browse" in the Secret File section
   - Choose file to hide
   - Check file size compatibility warning

3. **Optional Encryption**: 
   - Check "Use password encryption"
   - Enter a strong password

4. **Choose Output Path**: Click "Browse" in Output Video section
   - Select destination for steganographic video

5. **Configure Settings**:
   - Go to Settings tab
   - Choose algorithm (LSB or DCT)

6. **Hide Data**: Click "Hide Data in Video"
   - Monitor progress bar
   - Check log for status updates

### Extracting Hidden Data

1. **Select Steganographic Video**: Click "Browse" in the Extract tab
   - Choose video containing hidden data

2. **Password (if used)**: 
   - Check "File is password protected" if needed
   - Enter the correct password

3. **Choose Output Directory**: Select where to save extracted file

4. **Extract Data**: Click "Extract Hidden Data"
   - Monitor progress and check log

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. "Cannot open video file"**
- Check if video format is supported
- Ensure video file is not corrupted
- Try converting video to MP4 format

**2. "Secret file too large"**
- Use a higher resolution video
- Compress the secret file
- Choose LSB algorithm for higher capacity

**3. "Invalid password or corrupted data"**
- Verify the correct password
- Ensure same algorithm was used for hiding/extracting
- Check if video was modified after hiding data

**4. "Module not found" errors**
- Reinstall required packages
- Check Python version compatibility
- Use virtual environment if needed

### Performance Tips

1. **For Large Videos:**
   - Close other applications
   - Use SSD storage
   - Process during low system usage

2. **For Better Quality:**
   - Use high-resolution source videos
   - Choose DCT algorithm for important data
   - Avoid re-compressing videos

3. **For Maximum Capacity:**
   - Use LSB algorithm
   - Choose 1080p videos
   - Use longer duration videos

## Security Considerations

1. **Password Protection:**
   - Use strong, unique passwords
   - Don't share passwords through insecure channels
   - Consider using key files for additional security

2. **File Handling:**
   - Delete temporary files after use
   - Use secure deletion tools for sensitive data
   - Avoid storing passwords in plain text

3. **Video Distribution:**
   - Be aware of compression when uploading online
   - Test extraction after any video processing
   - Consider using lossless compression

## Advanced Usage

### Batch Processing

For processing multiple files, you can modify the main script to accept command-line arguments:

```python
import sys
if len(sys.argv) > 1:
    # Add command-line processing logic
    pass
```

### Custom Algorithms

To add new steganography algorithms:

1. Extend the `SteganographyEngine` class
2. Implement new hiding/extraction methods
3. Update the GUI algorithm selection

### Integration with Other Tools

The application modules can be imported and used in other Python scripts:

```python
from steganography_engine import SteganographyEngine
from video_processor import VideoProcessor

# Create instances and use programmatically
engine = SteganographyEngine()
processor = VideoProcessor()
```

## Technical Specifications

### Memory Requirements

- **LSB Algorithm**: ~2x video file size in RAM
- **DCT Algorithm**: ~3x video file size in RAM
- **Recommended**: 8GB RAM for 50MB videos

### Processing Time Estimates

- **480p video (5 min)**: 2-5 minutes
- **720p video (5 min)**: 5-10 minutes  
- **1080p video (5 min)**: 10-20 minutes

Times vary based on system specifications and algorithm choice.
