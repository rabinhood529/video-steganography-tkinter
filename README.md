## Usage Guide

### Embedding Secret Files

1. **Launch the application** by running `python main.py`
2. **Select the "Embed Secret File" tab**
3. **Choose your files**:
   - Browse for a cover video (max 50MB, 480p/720p/1080p)
   - Select a secret file to hide
   - Choose output location for the stego video
4. **Configure settings**:
   - Select embedding method (LSB or DCT)
   - Optionally enable password protection
5. **Check capacity**: Ensure your secret file fits within the video capacity
6. **Click "Embed Secret File"** and wait for completion

### Extracting Secret Files

1. **Select the "Extract Secret File" tab**
2. **Choose your files**:
   - Browse for the stego video containing hidden data
   - For DCT extraction, also select the original video
   - Choose output directory for extracted file
3. **Configure settings**:
   - Select extraction method (must match embedding method)
   - Enter password if data was encrypted
4. **Click "Extract Secret File"** and wait for completion

### Capacity Guidelines

The maximum secret file size depends on:
- **Video resolution**: Higher resolution = more capacity
- **Video duration**: Longer videos = more capacity
- **Embedding method**: LSB offers more capacity than DCT
- **Frame count**: More frames = more capacity

**Typical capacities**:
- 720p, 30fps, 60s video with LSB: ~500MB capacity
- 720p, 30fps, 60s video with DCT: ~50MB capacity

## Technical Details

### LSB Algorithm
- Embeds data in the least significant bits of pixel values
- Minimal visual impact on video quality
- Higher capacity but less secure against analysis
- Suitable for casual hiding of files

### DCT Algorithm
- Embeds data in frequency domain coefficients
- More robust against compression and analysis
- Lower capacity but higher security
- Requires original video for extraction

### Encryption
- Uses Fernet (AES-128) encryption with PBKDF2 key derivation
- 100,000 iterations for key strengthening
- Random salt generation for each encryption
- Password requirements: 8+ chars, mixed case, numbers

### File Format Support

**Secret Files**:
- Text: .txt, .doc, .docx (max 10MB)
- Images: .jpg, .png, .bmp, .gif (max 20MB)
- Videos: .mp4, .avi, .mov, .mkv (max 30MB)

**Cover Videos**:
- Formats: .mp4, .avi, .mov, .mkv, .wmv
- Resolutions: 854√ó480, 1280√ó720, 1920√ó1080
- Maximum size: 50MB

## Error Handling

The application includes comprehensive error handling for:
- **File validation**: Checks file existence, format, and size
- **Video validation**: Verifies resolution, codec, and properties
- **Capacity checking**: Prevents embedding oversized files
- **Password validation**: Ensures strong passwords
- **Process monitoring**: Tracks embedding/extraction progress
- **Exception logging**: Detailed error messages and logging

## Logging

All operations are logged to:
- **Console output**: Real-time status updates
- **GUI log panels**: In-application activity logs
- **Log file**: `video_steganography.log` for persistent logging

Log levels include INFO, WARNING, and ERROR messages for debugging and monitoring.

## Performance Considerations

### Embedding Time Estimates
- **LSB method**: ~10ms per frame
- **DCT method**: ~50ms per frame
- **Factors**: Resolution, frame count, file size

### Memory Usage
- Processes videos frame by frame to minimize memory usage
- Temporary data cleaned up automatically
- Suitable for videos up to 50MB on typical systems

### Quality Impact
- **LSB**: Minimal visible quality loss (<1% PSNR reduction)
- **DCT**: Slightly more visible but still imperceptible to casual viewing
- **Both methods**: Maintain video playability and compatibility

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Video file too large"**
- Ensure video is under 50MB
- Compress video or use shorter clips

**"Unsupported resolution"**
- Convert video to 480p, 720p, or 1080p
- Use video conversion tools like FFmpeg

**"Secret file too large"**
- Check capacity display in GUI
- Use shorter videos or smaller secret files
- Consider using LSB method for higher capacity

**"Cannot open video file"**
- Ensure video file is not corrupted
- Try different video formats
- Check file permissions

**"Extraction failed"**
- Verify embedding method matches extraction method
- Ensure correct password for encrypted data
- For DCT: provide the exact original video file

### Performance Issues
- Close other applications to free memory
- Use SSD storage for faster file I/O
- Consider shorter videos for faster processing

## Security Notes

### Best Practices
- Use strong passwords (8+ characters, mixed case, numbers)
- Keep original videos secure when using DCT method
- Delete temporary files after operations
- Use secure channels to share passwords

### Limitations
- LSB method vulnerable to statistical analysis
- DCT method requires original video for extraction
- No protection against video re-encoding attacks
- Suitable for casual privacy, not military-grade security
