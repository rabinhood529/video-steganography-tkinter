# Video Steganography Application - Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. Fixed Decryption Issues
- **Problem**: Encoding said "successful" but decryption failed every time
- **Root Cause**: Video compression was corrupting LSB (Least Significant Bit) data
- **Solution**: 
  - Added extensive debugging logs to track bit extraction process
  - Improved binary-to-bytes conversion with better error handling
  - Enhanced payload parsing with detailed error messages
  - Modified extraction to only process the first frame where data was hidden
  - Limited extraction to known payload size to avoid noise

### 2. Added Bar Graph Feature with Matplotlib
- **Implementation**: 
  - Added matplotlib dependency to requirements.txt
  - Created new "Capacity Analysis" tab in GUI
  - Implemented `show_capacity_comparison()` method with interactive bar graph
  - Added automatic capacity comparison when files are selected
  - Features:
    - Dynamic capacity calculation based on video resolution and frame count
    - Color-coded bars (green for compatible, red for too large)
    - Value labels on bars showing exact sizes in KB
    - Warning messages for oversized files
    - Separate popup window for detailed analysis

### 3. Enhanced GUI Features
- **New Tab**: "Capacity Analysis" with resolution and algorithm selection
- **Automatic Analysis**: Shows capacity comparison when secret file is selected
- **Interactive Graphs**: Bar charts comparing selected file size vs maximum capacity
- **Warning System**: Alerts users about video compression issues
- **Format Recommendations**: Suggests AVI format for best compatibility

## üîß Technical Improvements

### Steganography Engine Fixes
1. **Better Bit Extraction**: 
   - Fixed binary string to bytes conversion
   - Added proper padding handling
   - Improved error handling for incomplete data

2. **Enhanced Debugging**:
   - Added detailed console logs for encoding/decoding process
   - Track bit positions and payload sizes
   - Monitor header detection and metadata parsing

3. **Robust Payload Parsing**:
   - Better error handling for malformed payloads
   - Improved metadata extraction

### Video Processing Improvements
1. **Codec Selection**: 
   - Attempted to use lossless codecs (FFV1, H.264)
   - Fallback to uncompressed formats when possible
   - Added warnings about compression issues

2. **Format Recommendations**:
   - GUI warns users about MP4 compression issues
   - Suggests AVI format for best results
   - Provides clear guidance on format selection

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

### 1. Video Compression Problem
- **Issue**: Video codecs compress data, destroying LSB information
- **Impact**: Makes reliable extraction difficult with compressed formats
- **Workaround**: 
  - Use AVI format with uncompressed codec
  - Added user warnings about format selection
  - Implemented fallback mechanisms

### 2. Codec Compatibility
